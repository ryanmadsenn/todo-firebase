# todo-firebase

# Overview

This software is a todo webapp that uses the firestore cloud database to store todo items along with their state. 

I wrote this software because I wanted to learn more about cloud databases and a todo app is a perfect application to use with a cloud database.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

Firebase Firestore

Firebase's Firestore database is organized in a series of collections and documents. Collections store multiple documents, and documents store the information in key value pairs. For my todo app, I made a collection called "todos" that contains each individual todo as a document. Each todo document has the todo content and complete status.

# Development Environment

# Future Work
* Add the ability to create an account so that multiple users can store their todos in the app
* Add a login feature so that a user's todos are password-protected
